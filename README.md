### _By **Sharon Gray**_
## Description
_This webpage allows users to select which style and size of pizza to buy and which toppings to add, and the total price is revealed to the user once the "Submit Order" button is selected. Users also have the option of choosing to buy more than one pizza with different toppings of their choice. Underneath the total cost of the purchase, there will be a list of the type of pizzas that were ordered. There is also a delivery option if the user would like the pizza order to be delivered to them. To do this, there is an option whether to pick up the pizza or have it delivered, and once "delivery" is selected and the user fills out his or her contact information, the order will be set to deliver to that given address. This webpage uses HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, and jQuery to form this webpage into an interactive site._
